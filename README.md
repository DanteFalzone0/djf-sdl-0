# djf-sdl-0
Try `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev` for Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions if this code gives you errors. The programs
have instructions for compiling with g++ or gcc at their beginnings. I hear that SDL is cross-platform so it's not inconceivable
that these might be ported to a Mac, or even Windows, with relatively little difficulty.
