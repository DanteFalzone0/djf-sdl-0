NOTICE posted 30 December 2019

I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program.
The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would
write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository
as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent
repositories instead.

# djf-sdl-0
Try `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev` for Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions if this code gives you errors. The programs
have instructions for compiling with g++ or gcc at their beginnings. I hear that SDL is cross-platform so it's not inconceivable
that these might be ported to a Mac, or even Windows, with relatively little difficulty.
